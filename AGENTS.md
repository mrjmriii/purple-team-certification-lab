# AGENTS

This repository is AI-assisted and governed by `AGENTS.conf`.
If guidance conflicts, follow `AGENTS.conf`.

Key rules (summary):
- Public repo: no internal IPs/hostnames, no secrets, no credentials.
- Wazuh-only detection focus; Linux first.
- Safe, non-destructive simulations by default.
- Telemetry-first, one technique per script.
