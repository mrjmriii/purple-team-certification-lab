# Wazuh (planning stub)

Intended contents:
- Decoders for `_SIM` markers emitted by planned scripts (fields: action, path, dst, rc, etc.).
- Rules mapped to posture manifests' `expected_wazuh_alerts` (currently TODO-* placeholders).
- Sample alerts/log lines derived from script stdout/log markers.

Current state: planning only; no decoders or rules yet.
